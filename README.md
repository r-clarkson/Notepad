INTRODUCTION
------------
The "Notepad" program reads in text files that contain #hashtags and @mentions.

A note has a title denoted with a exclamation point, as well as references to other notes' titles with ^.

The program parses these files, organizes the information, and generates reports based on things like #hashtags, @mentions, and ^references.

Given the initial requirements for this assignment, we made the whole thing more complex than it needed to be. We only realized this after clarifications were made. At that point, we decided just to move forward with what we had instead of making things simpler/cleaner/less-bulky.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
Make sure Java 8 is installed.

Junit stuff?
