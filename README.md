[![BuildStatus](https://travis-ci.org/r-clarkson/Notepad.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/r-clarkson/Notepad)

INTRODUCTION
------------
The "Notepad" program reads in text files that contain #hashtags and @mentions.

A note has a title denoted with a exclamation point, as well as references to other notes' titles with ^.

The program parses these files, organizes the information, and generates reports based on things like #hashtags, @mentions, and ^references.

Given the initial requirements for this assignment, we made the whole thing more complex than it needed to be. We only realized this after clarifications were made. At that point, we decided just to move forward with what we had instead of making things simpler/cleaner/less-bulky.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
Make sure Java is installed/updated.

INSTALLATION/CONFIGURATION
--------------------------
1. Put the text files you wish to parse within the "notes" folder of this package (or you can enter filepath at runtime). There are test notes in there, and you can remove them if you wish.
2. CD into the "Notepad" directory of this program in terminal.
3. Run by copy/pasting the command "./gradlew run -q"
    ** "gradlew run -q" on windows
4. Perform tests by copy/pasting the command "./gradlew test"
    ** "gradlew test" on windows
5. If there are issues and the build fails, please try "gradle clean" and then "gradle build". If the build is successful, repeat steps 3 and 4. Otherwise, please contact our group.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------
1. The program requires user input; simply type commands as prompted

OUR THOUGHTS

Final Checkpoint: All features are working. We did the best we could with the time we had. Code is not as clean as it could be, but we tried to improve on what we had and do better with the new features. See comments for details.

Please note that dictation, although it "works", does not pick up words correctly for the most part. Although this likely depends upon microphones, this is also what we believe to be the API's quality. If we had known this ahead of time, we would have gone with Google or some other better API.

***

Checkpoint 2: The program is a little buggy, but core aspects of the note adding feature are working. Dictation and URL tracking have also been implemented. We have done the travis build (https://travis-ci.org/r-clarkson/Notepad) and added a gitignore as well. After we get aspects of each feature working the main goal will be to clean up our code and get the program running smoothly.

Commands that will currently work: add -d, add -i, filepath, all search options. The quit option works as well.
Commands that need to be added: delete options and add -t.

We originally had an incorrect concept of the requirements of this project, and this led the program to being more complicated than necessary. However, at the point that we got clarifications, we decided to simply move forward with what we had instead of trying to go backwards. So, at some points our code may look bulky. We did our best to document and make the code clean where we could.

We decided to use gradle. Testing does not currently work as "gradle build" fails due to file processing errors. This is because the program depends on user input to get the filepath. We do, however, have some test files. We did not get to finish them in time unfortunately, so there are some missing.

Thankfully, running the program works with gradle.

If you have any issues getting the program to read your files, please make sure the filepath doesn't have any extra spaces and ends with '/'. If you're having issues and your notes are in the specified "notes" folder, please contact me or Joe on basecamp.
